Algorithms to prepare yourself for CCDSAPs and other competitive exams. 
Getting ready for interviews and stuffs.

This repo consists of algorithms including :

1.Heaps (priority queue)
2.Disjoint Set Union
3.Segment Trees
4.Binary Index Tree (Fenwick tree)
5.Trees (traversals, tree dynamic programming)
6.Finding Lowest Common Ancestors (O(log N) solution where N is number of nodes).
7.Graph Algorithms:
  a.Finding connected components and transitive closures.
  b.Shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall)
  c.Minimum spanning tree (Prim and Kruskal algorithms)
  d.Biconnectivity in undirected graphs (bridges, articulation points)
  e.Strongly connected components in directed graphs
8.Topological Sorting
9.Euler path, tour/cycle.
10.Modular arithmetic including division, inverse
11.Amortized Analysis
12.Divide and Conquer
13.Advanced Dynamic Programming problems (excluding the dp optimizations which are added in expert level)
14.Sieve of Eratosthenes
